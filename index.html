    Reproducibility is a super big deal in science. It should also be a big deal in the world of cooking.
    If you have a great menu to share, then do so with enough precision for others to recreate it with high fidelity.

Here, I want to make great recipes I found online more accessible by adding precision after having tried them out myself.
